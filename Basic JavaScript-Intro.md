### Which one are we going to learn?

- Since this is the basics of JavaScript, it wouldn't matter if it's Vanilla JS or NodeJS.

### Environment Setup for learning?

- The easy way of executing JS can be done right into your browser's console tab.
- The second way is to go to [NodeJS Website](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download the "LTS" version of it.
- If you went with the second way you need a code editor to write code. I suggest [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
