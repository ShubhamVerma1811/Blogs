[![Sync Notion Blogs to GitHub](https://github.com/ShubhamVerma1811/Blogs/actions/workflows/update-blogs.yml/badge.svg?branch=main&event=schedule)](https://github.com/ShubhamVerma1811/Blogs/actions/workflows/update-blogs.yml)

This repo contains the blogs that I've written and which are currently live.

I use Notion as CMS for blogs, so this repo mainly acts as a way to sync those
blogs b/w Notion and GitHub. It runs a cron job that pulls in the Blogs from
Notion and save them as a markdown files.
