Let's start with Variables.

A Variable is a container that can hold a certain value, like in Maths we have
variable `x=2` or `x+y=2` where `x` and `y` are variables that can hold a
number.

In JS, we define a variable using `var` keyword.

```js
var a = 2; // here "a" holds the value 2
```

Here's an another example:

```js
var b = 6;
var c = 4;
console.log(b + c); // Now b = 4 and c = 6, so output will b +c i.e 10
```

Variables can hold various Data Types, which we'll learn in futher lessons.

For example:

```js
var greet = 'Hey There!'; // greet holds a String data type.
var age = 21; // age holds an integer data type.
```

NOTE: If you declare a variable with `var` keyword initially and the re-assign a
different value to it, the previous value gets overwritten.

```js
var name = 'Elon Musk';
console.log(name); // Elon Musk gets logged.

var name = 'Tesla';
console.log(name); // name is now Tesla, not Elon Musk
```

Next, We'll learn about Data Types in JavaScript.
