## What is Bytes?

Bytes is a platform to share bite-sized learnings of any tech topics.

---

## What inspired me to create Bytes?

- There are so many content creators out there that post such good content on various social media platforms. Due to that, the knowledge gets lost between their posts and the social media itself.

- So why not have a single platform where they could post their knowledgeable content.

- This idea helped in the creation of Bytes!

### Boring Avatars!

- They look cute too!

### Reactions

- As the name of the website is Bytes, the reactions to the posts are also considered a byte!

- So, if a post had 1024 üî• reactions, it would display it as 1KB üî•.

- Get it? 1024 Bytes = 1KB. Cool right!

## Future Additions

- The HashNode - HarperDB hackathon was a great opportunity to make something like [Bytes](https://bytes.vercel.app/)

- Until the hackathon, Bytes would run in demo mode, meaning it‚Äôll only allow ‚Äú4‚Äù images per post to reduce spam.

- If people find Bytes useful, in the future, Bytes could be an invite-only website where genuine content creators could post their learnings!

- And it‚Äôs Open source so, anyone is open to contributing/fork this project!

- I will be writing a separate blog explaining the technical parts of Bytes!
