### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I am Shubham Verma, a Frontend Developer from India. This is my first step into
the world of blogging.

The reason I wanted to get into blogging is that I am studying Computer Science
at my college. And there are a lot of my friends who don't understand
programming or they lack the basics of it. So, in this blog, I would be posting
blogs on the basics of those languages.
