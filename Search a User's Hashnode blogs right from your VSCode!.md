We spent most of our time in VSCode so why not even search blogs from it!

- The concept behind this extension was simple, Just enter the username of the
  person and the blogs get displayed right within code.
- From there you can search the blogs, choose the blog that you'd like to open.

This is the first feature of extension, I am planning to add more features to it
in the future like pagination.

Edit: Added Pagination!
